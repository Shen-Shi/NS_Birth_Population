The data and code available in paper "On the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars"

The file "Pulsar_SNR_obs.txt" includes the information of Galactic pulsars associated with supernova remnants, which are used in our population analysis. 

The columns in 'Pulsar_SNR_obs.txt' from left to right are respectively: the lower bound of supernova remnant age (kyr), the upper bound of supernova remnant age (kyr), characteristic age (kyr), observed period (s), statistical error of observed period, observed period derivative (s s^{-1}), statistical error of observed period derivative, strength of dipole field (G).
