The data sets used in paper: "On the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars" at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2024arXiv240214030D/arxiv:2402.14030

The data file "Pulsar_SNR_obs.txt" includes the data of selected Galactic pulsars associated with supernova remnants. 

In Pulsar_SNR_obs.txt, the columns from left to right are: the lower bound of supernova remnant age (kyr), the upper bound of supernova remnant age (kyr), characteristic age (kyr), observed period (s), statistical error of observed period, observed period derivative (s s^{-1}), statistical error of observed period derivative, strength of dipole field (G).

The data file 'P0_Pulsar.txt' provides the samples of initial periods for 39 pulsars. For each pulsar, 2000 samples are drawn from a Uniform distribution or Dirac \delta distribution. The details see the descriptions in Section 2 in our paper.
